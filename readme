AUTHENTICATION FLOW

1.Frontend shows the Lock, user signs up.
2.Configure a post-registration hook on Auth0 which calls POST /users on my backend. This call will generate my db's userId and send it back to Auth0.
3.Put this userId into Auth0's user_metadata.
4This user_metadata will be included in the JWT, so that all calls to my backend to fetch resources will include the db's userId
